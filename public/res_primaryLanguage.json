      "description": "üëã My name is Ella Svete and I am a jewelry designer, and studying to become a full stack developer.I decided to make a career switch to discover new ways I can participate in the professional art world, while simultaneously being stimulated and living a comfortable life. The future is headed even more towards tech than ever before  and it excites me to see all of the new opportunities that are arising. Function and design are essential to how we interact with the world, and the influence the tech industry has over these things is what inspired me to pursue this career. I owe my creative problem solving and love of hashing out ideas with a team to my background in craft and my education at The Evergreen State College. I am looking for a company that accommodates a healthy work-life balance, values team communication, and gets excited by people who have made a career change. ‚≠ê ",
